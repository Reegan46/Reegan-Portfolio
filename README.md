### 🧑‍💻 Overview

My personal portfolio website serves as both a **digital resume** and a showcase of my front-end development journey.  
It’s built from scratch using **React + Vite**, styled with **Tailwind CSS & Styled Components**, and optimized for performance and accessibility.  
The site features a **dark/light theme toggle**, smooth scroll animations, and a clean, developer-focused design.  

I’ve highlighted my **skills, professional experience, and real-world projects** — including those developed at KRAN Consulting — along with an interactive **contact form** that lets visitors reach me directly.
